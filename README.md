# Youtube playlist downloader

## Introduction

This is an script made in python that lets you download multiple youtube playlist just using a .txt file!

## How to use?

First at all, you'll need a PoToken and a Visitor Data: https://github.com/JuanBindez/pytubefix/pull/209.
(If you don't wanna get a PoToken you can go to main.py and at the line 21, delete client="WEB" and use_po_token="True", honestly i don't recommend it)

Once you have a PoToken and Visitor Data, copy the URLs of your playlist and paste to the .txt file, use a line for each URL.
When you have all of your URLs ready, double click de main.py file (you'll need a python interpreter, you can get one from microsoft store) and then the file will ask you where to save the playlist,
keep in mind that the downloader will save a folder for each playlist, but it will not create a folder for each channel, instead, you'll do it (sorry i didn't know how to create a folder for every channel).

(by the way, i know there are plenty more effiency projects, but this project its just for make a bigger portfolio)
